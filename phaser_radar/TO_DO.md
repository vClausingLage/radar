## PHASER JS RADAR

# To Dos

- USE A DIRECTION VECTOR TO SEE TARGET CHANGE DIRECTIONS
- ADD RWR ALERTS FOR ENEMIES THAT ARE RADAR TRACKED
- ADD TWS MODE
  - ADD POSSIBILITY FOR RADAR TO SAVE TRACKS / TARGETS
- COLLISION SHIP - ASTEROID NOT PRECISE
- PHYSICS CONTROLLER FOR COLLISIONS
- VISIBLILITY ON SHIP CLASSES TO PRIVATE / PROTECTED
- LOADOUT SHOULD ONLY BE IN SHIP NOT RADAR
- ASTEROID RENDERER
- VISIBILITY OF THINGS NEAR SHIP (SHIPS; ASTEROIDS) => ~ 250 UNITS?

# TWS

- Missile follows rarad intercept course, then activates its own radar to home in on target
- TWS to track multiple targets
- Logic for target history: how to correlate new radar returns with existing tracks
- target prorization by distance

# RADAR

- noise
- disatance
- cross section
