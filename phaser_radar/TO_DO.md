## PHASER JS RADAR

# To Dos

AIM :: DO AN ACTUAL RADAR SCAN IN STEPS RATHER THAN ALL AT ONCE (SEE lightRadar.ts)

- ADD RWR ALERTS FOR ENEMIES THAT ARE RADAR TRACKED
- PHYSICS CONTROLLER FOR COLLISIONS
- VISIBILITY ON SHIP CLASSES TO PRIVATE / PROTECTED
- LOADOUT SHOULD ONLY BE IN SHIP NOT RADAR
- ASTEROID RENDERER
- VISIBILITY OF THINGS NEAR SHIP (SHIPS; ASTEROIDS) => ~ 250 UNITS?
- TARGETS 'IN RANGE MUST BE IF 2 OF 4 CARD POINTS ARE IN MIN/MAX ANGLE

# RADAR

- noise
- disatance
- cross section

# TWS

- Missile follows rarad intercept course, then activates its own radar to home in on target
- TWS to track multiple targets
- Logic for target history: how to correlate new radar returns with existing tracks
- target prorization by distance
- ADD TWS MODE
  - ADD POSSIBILITY FOR RADAR TO SAVE TRACKS / TARGETS
- azimuth
- range
- wake up point missile
- missile radar
